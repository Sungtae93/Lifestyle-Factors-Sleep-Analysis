# Lifestyle-Factors-Sleep-Analysis
Analyzing how lifestyle factors affect sleep quality and duration using a real dataset

## Project Overview
This project explores how various lifestyle factors affect sleep quality and sleep duration. Using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset from Kaggle, we analyzed correlations and patterns in:

- Sleep duration
- Sleep quality
- Stress level
- Physical activity
- BMI
- Sleep disorders

The goal is to understand how these factors influence sleep and identify patterns that could help improve sleep health.

## Key Analyses
1. **Sleep Duration vs Sleep Quality**  
   Examined whether longer sleep is associated with better sleep quality.

2. **Stress Level vs Sleep Duration**  
   Investigated how stress affects the number of hours a person sleeps.

3. **Physical Activity vs Sleep Duration**  
   Analyzed if higher physical activity levels are related to longer sleep.

4. **BMI Category vs Sleep Quality**  
   Explored how body mass index affects sleep quality.

5. **Sleep Disorder vs Sleep Duration**  
   Checked if individuals with sleep disorders sleep fewer hours.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Google Colab

---

## Insights / Findings
- Longer sleep correlates with better sleep quality.  
- Higher stress levels are associated with shorter sleep duration.  
- Individuals with higher physical activity tend to sleep slightly longer.  
- Certain BMI categories are more likely to report poor sleep quality.  
- Sleep disorders negatively affect sleep duration.  
- Overall, lifestyle factors like stress, activity, BMI, and sleep disorders have a significant impact on sleep patterns.

## Dataset
[Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

---

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Google Colab.  
2. Upload the dataset CSV if prompted.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analyses and visualizations.

## Optional Enhancements
- Add more analyses, such as daily steps vs sleep quality.  
- Visualize trends using interactive plots.  
- Include recommendations for improving sleep based on findings.
